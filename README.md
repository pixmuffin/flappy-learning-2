# Flappy Learning Mod ([Demo](https://pixmuffin.github.io/flappy-learning-mod/))
## Folked from Flappy Learning ([Orginal Demo](http://xviniette.github.io/FlappyLearning/))

Original Flappy Learning takes around 30 seconds to made perfect, so make a extreme version to see how it does in more extreme level.

### Changes
* The height of the gap is now at a random height, sometimes wide and sometimes narrow.
* Population set to 80 instead
* Closer pipes intervals (original rate is 3, we set to 2)
* Wider piper (50px to 65px)
* (Random intervals) seems there is a bug if interval is random
